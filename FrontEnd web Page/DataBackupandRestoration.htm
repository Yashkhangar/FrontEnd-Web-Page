                    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Here's what we provide</span>
                    <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder;">Data Backup</p>
                    <li><b>Data Preservation:</b> Backup services create copies of data, including files, databases, applications, and system configurations, to ensure data is preserved and can be restored if needed.</li>
                    <li><b>Automated and Scheduled Backups:</b> Backup solutions often allow for automated and scheduled backups, ensuring that data is regularly and consistently saved without manual intervention.</li>
                    <li><b>Incremental and Differential Backups:</b> Backup services offer options to perform incremental or differential backups, which only back up data that has changed since the last backup. This reduces the time and storage space required for backups.</li>
                    <li><b>Backup Types:</b> Full backups create a complete copy of data, while differential backups store changes made since the last full backup. Incremental backups only include changes made since the last backup of any type.li>
                    <li><b>Versioning:</b> Many backup services retain multiple versions of files, allowing users to recover data from different points in time. This feature is valuable for recovering from accidental deletions or data corruption.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Compression and Deduplication:</b> Backup services often use data compression and deduplication techniques to minimize storage space requirements for backups.</li>
                    <li><b>Encryption:</b> Data is typically encrypted during the backup process to protect it from unauthorized access, both in transit and at rest.</li>
                    <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bolder;">Data Restoration</p>
                    <li><b>Point-in-Time Recovery:</b> Restoration services allow users to recover data from a specific point in time, whether it's the latest backup or a previous version. This is crucial for recovering data after a data loss event.</li>
                    <li><b>Granular Recovery:</b> Users can often restore individual files, folders, or specific data objects without needing to restore the entire backup.</li>
                    <li><b>Disaster Recovery:</b> In case of catastrophic events, such as hardware failures or natural disasters, data restoration services help organizations recover their systems and data to a functional state.</li>
                    <li><b>Fast Recovery:</b> Some services offer rapid recovery options to minimize downtime, such as instant virtual machine (VM) recovery or quick recovery of critical applications.</li>
                    <li><b>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</b> Restoration services are designed to work across various platforms and environments, including physical servers, virtual machines, cloud-based infrastructure, and hybrid environments.</li>
                    <li><b>User Self-Service:</b> Depending on the setup, end-users may have the ability to restore their own files or data without IT intervention, reducing downtime and administrative burden.</li>
                    <li><b>Verification and Testing:</b> Some backup and restoration solutions offer tools for verifying the integrity of backups and testing the restore process to ensure data recoverability.</li>
                    <li><b>Reporting and Auditing:</b> Services often provide reporting capabilities to track backup and restore activities, including success rates, error logs, and compliance with data recovery objectives (RTO and RPO).</li>
                    <li><b>Security:</b> Data restoration processes are typically secured to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information during recovery.</li>
                    <li><b>Scalability:</b> Backup and restoration solutions can scale to accommodate growing data volumes and changing business needs.</li>
