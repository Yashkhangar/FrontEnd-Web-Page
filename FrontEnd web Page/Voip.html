                    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Here's what we provide</span>
                    <li><b>Voice Calling: </b> VoIP services enable voice calls over the internet, allowing users to make and receive calls from anywhere with an internet connection. This includes local, long-distance, and international calls.</li>
                    <li><b>Video Calling:</b>Many VoIP services support video calls, enabling face-to-face communication through webcams or mobile device cameras. This is commonly used for virtual meetings, video conferencing, and personal video calls.</li>
                    <li><b>Instant Messaging:</b> This pricing model involves paying a fixed monthly or annual fee for a set amount of storage capacity. It's a predictable cost structure and is often used by small businesses or individuals.</li>
                    <li><b>Voicemail:</b> Some cloud backup services charge based on the number of users or devices that require backup. This can be helpful for organizations with multiple employees or devices to protect.</li>
                    <li><b>Call Forwarding:</b> Be aware of additional costs related to data transfer. Some providers charge for data upload and download, so if you frequently restore large amounts of data, these costs can add up.</li>
                    <li><b>Call Recording:</b> Some services offer different pricing tiers based on how long you want to retain your backups. Longer retention periods may come with higher costs.</li>
                    <li><b>Caller ID: </b> Cloud backup providers often offer additional services like disaster recovery, encryption, and advanced security features for an extra fee.</li>
                    <li><b>Call Conferencing: </b> Many cloud backup providers offer a limited amount of free storage, often with restrictions on data size or retention periods. This can be a good way to try out the service before committing to a paid plan.</li>
                    <li><b>Integration with Existing Phone Systems:</b> For large enterprises or customers with significant data storage needs, providers may offer volume discounts or custom pricing based on negotiation.</li>
                    <li><b>Number Portability:</b> Some providers offer discounts for longer-term contracts, such as annual plans as opposed to monthly plans.</li>
                    <li><b>Virtual Phone Numbers: </b> Some providers offer discounts for longer-term contracts, such as annual plans as opposed to monthly plans.</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile Apps:</b>VoIP providers typically offer mobile apps for smartphones and tablets, enabling users to make calls and access their communication tools while on the go.</li>
                    <li><b>Cost Savings:</b>VoIP services are often more cost-effective than traditional phone services, especially for long-distance and international calls, making them an attractive option for businesses looking to reduce communication expenses.</li>
                    <li><b>Security Features: </b> VoIP services incorporate security measures like encryption to protect voice and data transmissions, helping to safeguard sensitive information.</li>
                    <li><b>Scalability:</b>  VoIP solutions are scalable, allowing businesses to easily add or remove users and features as their needs change.</li>
