                    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Here's what we provide</span>
                    <li><b>Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG):</b> In this model, you pay for the storage and resources you use on a per-gigabyte or per-terabyte basis. This is a flexible option suitable for businesses with varying backup needs.</li>
                    <li><b>Tiered Storage:</b> Some providers offer tiered pricing based on the amount of data you need to back up. For example, the more data you store, the lower the per-gigabyte cost. This encourages users to back up more data, which can be useful for large enterprises.</li>
                    <li><b>Flat-Rate or Fixed Pricing:</b> This pricing model involves paying a fixed monthly or annual fee for a set amount of storage capacity. It's a predictable cost structure and is often used by small businesses or individuals.</li>
                    <li><b>Per-User Pricing:</b> Some cloud backup services charge based on the number of users or devices that require backup. This can be helpful for organizations with multiple employees or devices to protect.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Transfer Costs:</b> Be aware of additional costs related to data transfer. Some providers charge for data upload and download, so if you frequently restore large amounts of data, these costs can add up.</li>
                    <li><b>Retention Period:</b> Some services offer different pricing tiers based on how long you want to retain your backups. Longer retention periods may come with higher costs.</li>
                    <li><b>Add-On Services:</b> Cloud backup providers often offer additional services like disaster recovery, encryption, and advanced security features for an extra fee.</li>
                    <li><b>Free Tier:</b> Many cloud backup providers offer a limited amount of free storage, often with restrictions on data size or retention periods. This can be a good way to try out the service before committing to a paid plan.</li>
                    <li><b>Volume Discounts:</b> For large enterprises or customers with significant data storage needs, providers may offer volume discounts or custom pricing based on negotiation.</li>
                    <li><b>Contract Length:</b> Some providers offer discounts for longer-term contracts, such as annual plans as opposed to monthly plans.</li>
